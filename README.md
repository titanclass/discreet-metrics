discreet-metrics
===

A high-performance/low-overhead metrics library aiming to conform with [OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/) and satisfy the following goals:

* memory requirements for metrics are deterministic and fixed at compile time
* able to run on no-std targets as well as std
* sympathetic to hardware with limited support for atomics and floating types
* avoid the use of an allocator to support bare metal targets

As this library is intended to run on resource-constrained targets, you can expect good performance on targets in general.

An example
---

```rust
use core::ptr::NonNull;
use discreet_metrics::{ encoders::text::TextEncoder, metrics::counter::Counter, MetricDesc, Registry };
use std::sync::Once;

// A registry will be typically declared in a static
static REGISTRY: Registry = Registry::new();

// Then referenced from within a file where it is required
// ```
// extern "Rust" {
//    static REGISTRY: Registry<'static>;
//}

// Declare a metric in a file where it is used, again as a static
static SOME_METRIC: Counter = Counter::new();
static mut SOME_METRIC_DESC: MetricDesc = 
    MetricDesc::new("some-metric", "Some metric", None, &["some-label"], &SOME_METRIC);

// Register the metric descriptor - once, and only once! The following is achieved
// using std::sync::Once.
static SOME_METRIC_DESC_REG: Once = Once::new();
SOME_METRIC_DESC_REG.call_once(|| {
    REGISTRY.register(unsafe { NonNull::new(&mut SOME_METRIC_DESC as *mut _).unwrap() });
});

// Do what we do with metric counters!
SOME_METRIC.inc();

// Elsewhere, establish the encoder and output its bytes somewhere 
// either periodically or on demand.
let mut encoder = TextEncoder;
let _encoder = REGISTRY.encode(&mut encoder);
```
